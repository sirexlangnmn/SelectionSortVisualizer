# 📚 Today’s Lesson: Selection Sort Algorithm

Welcome to the **Selection Sort Visualizer** project! This repository includes a simple and interactive demonstration of the **Selection Sort algorithm** — a fundamental concept in computer science education.

## 🧠 What is Selection Sort?

**Selection Sort** is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) item from the unsorted part of a list and moves it to the sorted part.

It’s like choosing the best item (e.g., smallest) from a list and placing it where it belongs, step by step, until the entire list is sorted.

## ❓ Why Was Selection Sort Invented?

Selection Sort was created as a:

- 📌 **Simple to understand** sorting method (great for early learners and early computers).
- 🔁 **In-place algorithm** – it doesn’t require extra memory.
- 🎯 **Predictable behavior** – always performs a known number of comparisons and swaps.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🔹 Start at the first item in the list.
2. 🔍 Look through the unsorted part of the list to find the **smallest** item.
3. 🔄 Swap it with the current position.
4. 👉 Move to the next position.
5. 🔁 Repeat until the list is fully sorted.

## 📅 When to Use It?

- ✅ When working with **small lists**.
- ✅ When **simplicity** is more important than speed.
- ✅ When memory is limited (no extra space required).

---

## ✅ Pros

- 🧩 Easy to understand and implement.
- 🧮 Consistent (always (n-1) swaps).
- 💾 Memory-efficient (in-place sorting).
- 👍 Great for teaching algorithm basics.

---

## ⚠️ Cons

- 🐢 Slow for large datasets – **O(n²)** time complexity.
- ❌ Not optimal for real-time or performance-critical applications.
- 🔄 Doesn’t benefit from partially sorted data.

## 🧩 5 Simple Real-World Use Cases

- 👨‍🏫 Sorting a class roll call alphabetically.
- 🏆 Ranking top 5 scores in a quiz game.
- 📚 Organizing a small shelf of books by height.
- ✅ Prioritizing tasks manually on sticky notes.
- 🛒 Arranging shopping items by price in a small cart.
